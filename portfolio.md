<strong>When I first</strong> got myself into the marketing and communications department, I was naive to think everything I studies and learned from universities was good enough to contribute to the company I "serve" at that time. I was wrong! There were many things I didn't/couldn't know about unless I get my hands dirty doing all the necessary steps. And then I was involved with the graphic and packaging design process which open my eyes of the importance of design elements that influences a person's decision; be it in the field of retail industries to eCommerce online, everything got to do with design elements! We are now living in the era whereby design plays an important role in decision making. Gone are the days whereby consumer purchase purely based on features/functions. Especially for new brands or products, consumers are more likely to trust them based on the design, shape, and even pricing they see. It is the same as your business website. If you want to build your brand, you can't purely rely on social media channels. You got to have your own website because consumers will search for you once they notice your ads in any of these channels.<br>
<strong>So what can you do to build your brand?</strong><br>
Below are two of my portfolio that I have helped my clients.

However, as their business grows, they started to expand their services such as wallpaper for your living room, bedroom, etc. They also provide laminate flooring that is affordable, easy installation, easy clean and beautifully designed. Beside that, they do provide artificial grass that doesn't need weekly maintenance. Save your time while you can still enjoy the greenness in any area of your house.

<h3><strong><a href="http://www.cogssandakan.com" target="_blank">2. The Church of Good Shepherd, Sandakan</a></strong></h3>

<strong>The Church of Good Shepherd or COGS Sandakan</strong> is my first involvement in a non-profit organization. There are many challenges where I have to overcome. After extensive research, simplicity and good user experiences were used. Some words were not used such as "ministry" because we believe a church website is not just for their members, but also for new visitors who aren't familiar with the church culture and environment. Thus we simplify everything and emphasize "Events/Activities" as our main contents under announcement. Events being categorized as "Upcoming, Ongoing and Past events" for easy understanding of all our activities. Beside that, we also want our members able to share and invite their friends when these events become available. Another important thing is the language which we don't want to just translate. We want to personalize content whereby it is only for a specific target audience based on their preferred language. Thus 3 languages with different contents of events/activities were chosen. This is a good example to deliver relevant content to the target audience. You only want to receive content that is related to you, not the opposite.
