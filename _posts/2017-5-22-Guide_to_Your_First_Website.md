<strong>Creating</strong> your own website is not as simple as you think. Not when you are creating your own website for the first time. Thus, I am now writing this to teach you how to avoid necessary troubles, minimum investment and productive by focusing on these areas. 

<h3><strong>Step 1: Get Your Own Domain Name</strong></h3>

In other words, your IP address or name that you want to give to your website. For example the domain name of this website you're reading is "www.onlinebah.com". To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. It's sort of like registering a business name before you can start operating. If you want to know more, here is the article <strong><a href="{{ site.url }}/2017/06/23/How_To_Buy_Domain_Name.html">How to Buy a Domain Name</a></strong> to help you. 

<h3><strong>Step 2: Choose a Web Host and Sign Up for an account</strong></h3>

A web host is basically a company that has many computers(servers) connected to the Internet. When you place your web pages on their computers, everyone in the world will be able to connect to it and view them anytime. Choosing a web host is like renting office or shop premises for your business. 
<!--There are a lot of web host companies and you can read more about it in this article “How to choose a web host for your company”. -->

<h3><strong>Step 3: Design your Web Pages or Hiring a Professional Web Developer</strong></h3>

Firstly, if you want to design your own website, there are numbers of website builders that you can use, such as WIX, Weebly, uKit or XPRS. Some of them require a monthly subscription fee in order to use them and normally they come with web host services as well. They are drag-and-drop site builder which is easy to use for anyone who doesn't require programming knowledge. You can do it without any coding experience. 
<!--Secondly, if you want to hire a professional web developer, here is the article “Hiring a Professional for your Website” which you need to read before approaching them. -->

<h3><strong>Step 4: Appearance and Usability</strong></h3>

Every product goes through life-cycle and being tested by consumer. In web design, your website need to be tested all the time. You have to know how visitors react when they reached the homepage, which articles they read the most. Why they didn't sign up for your newsletter? Did they miss out any important notification? Do they like the layout? What is their first impression of your website? All these need to be answered and by knowing them, you can update website according to these feedbacks. I have written some of the case studies here. You may want to check it out for better understanding.

<h3><strong>Step 5: SEO – Finding you locally in the web</strong></h3>

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the ranking system that Google has engineered for every search result, they provide when you type your words in the google search bar. Google will understand your website by reading the content that you put in. That's include the images and videos. 
<!--The article “Ways to create an SEO friendly website” is a must read. Moreover, “How to Improve your Search Engine Ranking on Google" is also important for the simple reason that Google is the most popular search engine around.-->

<h3><strong>Step 6: Testing your website</strong></h3>

Although I list this step separately, it should be done throughout your web design cycle. I list it here to give it a little more prominence, since too few new webmasters actually perform it adequately. You will need to test your web pages as you design them in the major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge. All these browsers can be obtained free of charge, so it should be no hardship to get them. Unfortunately, directly testing your site is the only way you can be really sure that it works the way you want it to on your visitors' machines. In addition, you also have to test your smartphone. Today, smartphone is the No.1 Device which people used to visit the website.
