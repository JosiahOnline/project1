<h3><strong>Know Your Channels</strong></h3>
In any business, you want to build content for your target audience/customers, offer advices to help them avoid mistakes or step by step guide to build trust with you; That's right, the more they see, read or hear about you/your brand, the easier it is to build trust through these opportuinities. Customers will only buy from those persons/brands they trust. They don't buy from stranger.
So the next question is "How do you build trust through your website and social media platforms?".

<h3><strong>1.Understand what website can do</strong></h3>
A lot of businesses don't really understand or utilizing their websites. Website is more than just introducing your services and products. It is a brand that customers recognized. For example, if you go to Lazada ecommerce, you are most likely purchase products without any issue of trust. This is because you already heard about Lazada from different channels like radio, newspaper, magazine, tv and even your friends(word of mouth). So if you are stranger to them, customers will do a online research about your brand/businees before they purchase. This is true according to studies. 81% of customers do online research before they purchase. Why they do it? Because they want to know more about you. Your website is not just information, but also a presentation platform that engage with your visitors. Your website becomes the first place they will search online and it is the first impression that tell them who you are, what you do, and most importantly "can you be trusted?"
We are familiar with ecommerce such as Lazada, 11streets, Taobao and Shopee. But if i ask you to purchase product from Ubuy(www.ubuy.com.my), you more likely hesitate to buy. This is because you never heard about it from other channels especially in Malaysia.
So the next step is to understand "what can social media offer to business owner?".

<h3><strong>2.Understand what Social Media offer</strong></h3>
All social media offer the same thing, a platform free of charge to create your own account and engage to any audience you could find in your own way. Facebook does offer ads which you can target certain audience based on your preferrences. However you may want to build your fan base before you start to do Facebook Ads. Fan base means to get 1 thousand (any numbers you want) of followers before you start to promote any of your services or products. That's the right way to use Social Media platform. You sell to potential customers who like/trust you. If you don't know how to do it, I give you a simple exercise, find your competitors, industry leaders or famous brand, observe how they create post in Facebook. What are the activities they do and how they engage with their followers? This is the simplest and easy way to learn from them. Tell me about your learning after this exercise. I would love to hear you out.

<h3><strong>3.The relationship between Your website and Social Media</strong></h3>
Now you get the idea of these 2 platforms. Next is to know how to use them to engage your customers effectively. First, you create a post to promote your latest services or products in your Facebook account, assuming you have 1 thousand of followers (remember to add a link to your website). Then maybe 10% or more of your followers saw the post and if they want to know more details, they can click on the link. When they click, they will be lead to a nice presentation (your website) not only show the details but also creating interest. The goal of Facebook or social media is to create awareness, whereby the goal of your website is to create interest. These 2 goals are part of the process we called <strong>"AIDA" Sales Funnel. </strong>. <br><strong>A = Awareness<br>I = Interest<br>D = Desire<br>A = Action</strong><br>
Sales Funnel means the buyer's journey to purchase. There are many different ways to do it.
No one knows about your latest products or services until you tell them. That's why there is roadshow, tv ads, radio ads, newspaper ads, Facebook ads, etc. All these activities are meant to create sales through "AIDA" Sales Funnel. If you want to learn more, google it and tell me what you have gained. <br>

<h3><strong>2.Choose the right channels</strong></h3>
Different channels have their own different audience. Thus You have to decide what kind of customers you want to target. Since these channels have big informations about their audience, you might need to do research and understand them beforehand. For example, if you opened a Pet Shop and you want to target people who love animals; the easiest way is to use Facebook. Nowadays Facebook has become the first social media platforms to be used because of it's functionality and almost everyone has a facebook account. You can create "page" or "group" specifically for your businesses and straight away look for your customers.

<h3><strong>3.Create Awareness</strong></h3>
They all come with the same strategy, create awareness of your brand through these channels.  All these activities were meant to create awareness in what we called "Sales Funnel" in marketing term. In corporate practice there is a basic Sales Funnel which we called <strong>"AIDA"</strong>. <br><strong>A = Awareness<br>I = Interest<br>D = Desire<br>A = Action</strong><br>


This is because of huge personal data which they have being gathering since many years ago. Now they are offering these informations to marketers or owners who want to advertise based on personal preferences, hobbies, interest, group, etc.-->
