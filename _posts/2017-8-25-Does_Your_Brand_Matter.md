Nowadays almost every companies should have their own website. Whenever customers want to know you more, the first thing they do is to google your brand. Thus having a website is more than just putting information and description of your products and services. It is about engaging visitors with useful content that excel from the rest of your competitors. By doing so, you are telling your visitors you are one of the best in your industry. 
However the funny thing is that most of the companies doesn't maintain their website, giving visitors a bad impression of your brand. Imagine a company doesn't even take care of their own website, do you really think they will give their best when dealing with customers? Forget about regular customers, you are losing out all the chances of getting new customers every time they visit your website. No wonder business stagnant and new customers are hard to come by. You need a new strategies and luckily it's not hard to fix it. 
Below are some of the ways you can use: 

<h3><strong>Step 1: Set your business goal for your website correctly</strong></h3>

We all know business means business. You need to generate profit in order to continuously deliver values to your customers. Having a website may have different goals at different stages. At the beginning stage, your business goal through website might be create awareness and engage user regularly. If your business is about providing services such as building website. Then your business goal might be getting contact list from potential clients to your sales team. These can be done through features such as LiveChat, News Subscription for your email marketing, FREE Soft-Copy of Valuable Advice in exchange of their email, and many more. Based on these goals, you can set your strategies and work around by integrating the necessary features into your website.

<h3><strong>Step 2: Design that matters</strong></h3>

The more value you put into your website, the better brand perception you might conceive in your customer's mind. Good design and bad design does make a difference when customer decide which one to go. A good design brings customer to the right direction whereby bad design confused customer. Since website is your first impression for new visitors, you must know how to present your company clearly (perhaps the most important/difficult of this article).

<h3><strong>Step 4: Test it with others</strong></h3>

Select a group of people and ask for feedback about your website. You may categorized them into people who have little or no knowledge of your industries and people who are expert in that industries. Then observe how they interact with your website. Which page they spend more time or less.? Which button did they click? Do they understand the content? Is it user friendly or having troubles of navigating? Are the text too small or big? They more questions you ask, the more answer/deeper understanding of your visitors. Make mistakes and learn fast from them. Do not be afraid of mistakes because it is unavoidable for every industries. 

<h3><strong>Step 5: Spend Time on SEO & Google Analytic</strong></h3>

This is a huge step for Startup, you can collect a lot of user data for your website by using FREE Google Analytic. SEO means Search Engine Optimization. It is the ranking system that Google used to rank your website. If it contain valuable resources or information, then your website will be ranked higher than others. 
On the other hand, Google Analytic is FREE and used to analyze your website. It contains data that is useful to understand your visitors. Data such as how many visitors visit your website, which platform they use, Desktop, Tablet or Mobile? Which page they visit at your website, and many more. It will takes sometime to understand these data. Thus I have written 2 separate articles for Improve Your SEO Ranking and How to understand Google Analytic which you can check it out. 

<h3><strong>Step 6: Social Media</strong></h3>

How can we live in this world without social media nowadays? As long as you have a smart phone, you are entitled to any social media platform that are available for free. But do bear in mind, the purpose of company using social media is to converse not just creating awareness, attraction. You want visitors to speak with you, whether they are satisfied with your products and services or not. If you want to know more, read my article “Social Media that Power Your Brand”.

Ever thought of creating your own ad without big investment? Now is your chance. Creating your own video is simple nowadays with a lot of tools and references which you can take advantage of. Video speak better than image and words(at least that's I prefer instead reading). Motion is interesting and thus creating your own ad, educating your customers provide values.

<h3><strong>Step 8: Start Blogging</strong></h3>

Blogging? Really? What is the worth of blogging when everybody is busy with facebook, whatsapp, youtube and even now snapchat? Well, the main reason visitors will and definitively read your blog is because they are looking for answer. Answer can be in any form, some prefer to watch it in video, while others through blog. If you are an expert in your field, and you offer advice through blogging, won't you think visitors who have no knowledge would like to read about it? They do and most importantly they want to hear it from the expert!Thus the quality of your content does make a differences. Do not do it just for the sake of blogging. Do it by giving genuine, best advice that add value to visitors. By doing these, word spread, Google rank your site higher because more visitors value your content. This is one of the key success which many companies failed to do it correctly.

In another word, “if you are not getting new customers in your community, then it's time to enlarge your territory”. It's time to build your brand and stand out among your competitors.
