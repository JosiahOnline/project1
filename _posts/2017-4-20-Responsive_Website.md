<h3><strong>What is Responsive Website?</strong></h3>
Almost every client wants a mobile version of their website nowadays. This is because everyone google through their smartphone. According to studies (OpenSignal report), there are more than 24,000 unique Android devices - both smartphones and tablets and they are accounted 81.7 percent of the global market share. Whereby iOS (iPhone, ipad) is just 17.9 percent and the rest is Microsoft Window Phones and Blackberry (in which both already lose out in the market). 
Gone are the days whereby we only search answers through our computer or laptops. Now you can access the internet through many devices: desktop (computer), Notebook(laptop), tablets (ipad, Kindle) and smartphone (Samsung, Vivo, Huawei, iPhone, etc). 

<h3><strong>So how do you keep up with all these unique devices?</strong></h3>
The answer is responsive website. Responsive Website means your website can be view by any kind of devices, it is a mobile version that fits into these screens perfectly. Responsive Website makes your web page looks good and consistent across all devices. It was a concept started back in 2010 due to the growth of tablets and smartphone with many different resolutions and screen size. Back in those days it is very difficult to maintain these design with so many different screen sizes. Thus the concept was borned with the intention to solve this problems and speed up the process in daily maintanance.
